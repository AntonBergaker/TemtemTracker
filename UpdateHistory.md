### V4.4

#### New features

- Added Cipanku Temtem
- This includes an update to the OCR whitelist to include characters 0 and 1 for 0b1 detection. This may potentially reduce accuracy at low resolutions.
- Added 3 pixels of top and bottom padding to table rows. This should hopefully prevent buttons from being cut off at the top
- Added Wiplump Lovers theme

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Updated Tesseract version to 4.1.1

#### Known issues

- TemtemTracker does not track the changes in odds when chaining encounters using a radar
- Font size scaling from primary monitor causes font to be tiny on secondary monitor with higher resolution/different scaling. This is an issue with the underlying framework and can not yet be addressed at this time. 
- False detections/Missed detections are still possible on water encounters with clouds in the background
- Issue in optical character recognition library causes crash on systems with processors that do not support vector operations. This will be fixed when the fixes are accepted and merged into the library and make it downstream.

### V4.3

#### New features

- Added Koish
- Updated the base luma chance to 1/10000

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Nothing new here, sorry folks

#### Known issues

- TemtemTracker currently does not detect the chaining method and adjust odds for it. A closer look at this will be taken at a later time, but no promises since the chaining method displays numbers anyway.
- Font size scaling from primary monitor causes font to be tiny on secondary monitor with higher resolution/different scaling. This is an issue with the underlying framework and can not yet be addressed at this time. 
- False detections/Missed detections are still possible on water encounters with clouds in the background
- Issue in optical character recognition library causes crash on systems with processors that do not support vector operations. This will be fixed when the fixes are accepted and merged into the library and make it downstream.

### V4.2

#### New features

- Added Momo
- Added Temtem Window/Process names for GeForce NOW.

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Fixed version in about window showing V4.0, set to V4.2
- Replaced hardcoded Window/Process names pairs with retieval from config file. This enables savvy users to add new names for Temtem processes and Windows should other services they use somehow modify these. 

#### Known issues

- Font size scaling from primary monitor causes font to be tiny on secondary monitor with higher resolution/different scaling. This is an issue with the underlying framework and can not yet be addressed at this time. 
- False detections/Missed detections are still possible on water encounters with clouds in the background
- On some systems an issue with the VC++ will cause the tracker to crash when detecting Temtem in combat. The root cause seems to lie in the VC++ instalation on on the user's PC, but the exact source is still unknown

### V4.1

#### New features

- Added Kisiwan Temtem species

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Fixed deadlock that would sometimes cause the tracker to become unresponsive

#### Known issues

- Font size scaling from primary monitor causes font to be tiny on secondary monitor with higher resolution/different scaling. This is an issue with the underlying framework and can not yet be addressed at this time. 
- False detections/Missed detections are still possible on water encounters with clouds in the background
- On some systems an issue with the VC++ will cause the tracker to crash when detecting Temtem in combat. The root cause seems to lie in the VC++ instalation on on the user's PC, but the exact source is still unknown

### V4.0

#### New features

- Support for Temtem windows in Sandboxie (only default window names with [#] appended and prepended, no sandbox names)
- Statistics Window
- Added Yami (made by Yami) and GracefulKlutz styles

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Improved error logging level of detail. Now your logs will make it easier for me to help you get the tracker running
- Decreased number of pixels necessary for objects to no longer be recognized as letters, speeding up detection
- Added additional checks to post-OCR, eliminating some sources of false and missed detections
- Fixed coding error that would make Myx undetectable due to the name being too short
- Added shutdown prevention to prevent table.json file corruption due to shutdown happening before the table can be written
- Fixed menu Unpause button not starting Timer back up after autopause
- Fixed 4:3 Aspect Ratio detection spots being wrong
- Fixed detection issues on lake in Citerior Omninesia (still missing spots in 16:3 aspect ratio)
- Fixed Individual Window timer showing 00:00:00 if timer is paused right after tracker is started

#### Known issues

- Font size scaling from primary monitor causes font to be tiny on secondary monitor with higher resolution/different scaling. This is an issue with the underlying framework and can not yet be addressed at this time. 
- False detections/Missed detections are still possible on water encounters with clouds in the background

### V3.1

#### New features

- Added 16:3 and 4:3 aspect ratios to config
- Added support for multiple Temtem windows/clients running simultaneously
- Added log generation for unhandled crashes
- Added auto-pause feature to settings
- Changed style organization from single file to individual style folders/manifests. This should make it easier to share styles
- Added more robust and informative error handling for styles to support style development
- Added additional options to styles: tableRowButtonBorderColor and toolStripBackground
- Added individual tracking windows, minimalist windows that can be used to track a single Temtem while still keeping an eye on time and temtem/h. 

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Fixed detection not working monitors other than main monitor

### V3.0

Version 3 is a port to C# with optimizations, rewrites and cleanup

#### New features

- Opacity. Make the tracker transparent and get it out of your way.
- Window Styles. Chose the window design that you like best. Tsukki is my favourite :)
- Visual indication of paused time. See if your timer is paused.
- Hotkey remapping. No longer be at the mercy of my poor choice of hotkeys
- Autosave. PC crashed? No worries! Your tracking data is automatically saved now.
- Save/Load. Want to track multiple things? Save your current table and refresh the timer. Load it later and continue tracking!
- Don't want the tracker showing you caught a Temtem when it was paused? There's an option for that in the settings.
- Sexy icons by Alice (Parou) Peters [alicepeters.de](https://alicepeters.de), [parou.moe](https://parou.moe)
- Added about window with a little info
- Pause and Reset now also show up in menu with shortcuts shown, in case you forget.
- Added error messages for certain problems, you will hopefully never see these :)

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Severely reduced memory and CPU impact by switching to C#
- Optimizations in detection loop to reduce CPU usage
- Fixed other windows sometimes tricking the tracker due to having Temtem in their names
- Improved detection algorithm now supports low resolutions (tested 720p)
- Better pre-OCR cleanup to minimize false detections

### V2.5

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Fixed tracker not starting when time spent exceeds Time to Luma due to the expected time being negative

### V2.4

#### Bugfixes/optimization

-Fixed Total no longer working after removing a row from the table and encountering the same Temtem

### V2.3

#### Bugfixes/optimization

-Fixed out of bounds problem with pre-OCR image cleanup that could sometimes occur and stop the tracker from working

### V2.2

#### Bugfixes/optimization

-Fixed possible concurrency issue that may be culprit behind table sometimes no longer updating
-Fixed Temtem/h not being set back to 0 when every temtem has been manually removed from the table

### V2.1

#### Bugfixes/optimization

-Fixed Encountered % not being multiplied by 100

### V2.0

#### New features

- Redesigned interface with new capabilities
- Ability to remove Temtem from tracking list
- Persistence of tracking information across tracker restarts
- Ability to export tracking data in CSV format (Excel, Google Sheets, Open Office/Libre Office Calc)
- Ability to pause/resume timer (F8)
- Remapped table reset to F5 since F5 is more commonly associated with refreshing
- Time to Luma estimates (for 99.99% chance of having encountered a Luma and 50% chance)
- Saipark mode with the ability to adjust Luma rates for 2 Temtem (does not affect Total calculation)
- Support for windowed mode using JNA

#### Bugfixes/optimization

- Further modifications to pre-OCR image cleanup to compensate for white vines in Mines of Mictlan
- Removed unnecessary screenshot re-takes from OCR loop, reducing performance overhead

### V1.2

- Modifications to pre-OCR image cleanup code to take into account alpha channel on colors
- This should fix the high false-detection rate in Omninesia

### V1.1

- Added support for different resolutions with different detection spots in the config file
